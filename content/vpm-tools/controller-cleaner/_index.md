## How to use

> [!CAUTION]
> **Always have a backup**, I am not responsible for any broken animators.

1. Select an animator controller by clicking on the circle on the right of the object-field
2. Click `Scan`
3. Click `Clean` if needed

### Do all animators at once

> [!CAUTION]
> **It's not recommended scanning and cleaning all animators.** This will probably break some stuff. Only use it on the animators you made.

1. Click the `Scan All Controllers` button below the object-field
2. Either clean the ones you wish to clean, or clean them all by clicking `Clean All`
