There are 2 main ways to create toggles in Unity, [Direct Blend Tree](direct-blend-tree) and [Layers](layer-toggle). Both have their strengths and weaknesses.

`Direct Blend Trees` are generally considered more performant than `Layers` for lots of simpler toggles. While `Layers` can have much more complex logic, at the cost of performance when having a lot of them.

Be sure you have seperate `On` and `Off` animations before you begin with [Direct Blend Tree](direct-blend-tree) and [Layers](layer-toggle). If not look at [Creating Toggle Animation](creating-toggle-animation)
